Data Analysis and Machine Learning

Implementation of a few data algorithms as part of university project.

Implemented:
- a faster variation of the K Means Clustering algorithm, improvement
that was made possible using vectorizations.
- Page Rank algorithm, the algorithm used by Google to rank web pages based on
frequency of visiting and how pages link to one another (connectivity)
- an algorithm for cat recognision in two steps, learning from a large data set
of cat pictures and testing the performance of the algorithm on a large data
set of various animals pictures. An accuracy of 85% was achieved using 2
different numerical methods, Householder and Gradient Descent.
